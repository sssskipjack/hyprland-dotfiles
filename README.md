👁 Serial Experiments Lain Themed Dotfiles | Arch Linux + Hyprland

My dotfiles are inspired by Serial Experiments Lain, blending a minimal cyberpunk aesthetic with functional efficiency. Configured for Hyprland, Doom Emacs, Neovim, and a keyboard-driven workflow, my setup prioritizes speed, control, and a cohesive visual style.

🖥️ Screenshot Preview: Featuring Neofetch, Btop, and Neovim running in a seamless, monochrome setup.
